  When I was looking to make a career change that would better myself going forward in fall of 2019. I was looking into a few things of interest. I love sports, music, and traveling. I wanted to find not only a new career path, but something that would be fun to succeed in. 

  I have always had interest in computer programming and technology just in general. When I went through numorous job sites looking at what was available out in the world I was reminded that this was almost what my original career was. When I first started school back in 2003 I was in a Computer Programming degree programming before ultimately switching to Business Administration. I made the switch solely because I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with my life and ended up in the world of Auto Finance because I love working with numbers, problem solving, and loved being around car shows. This wore on me after 14 years. 
	
	In January 2020 I started looking into coding bootcamps and refreshing my memory on JavaScript.  When Covid hit the world, I, like many people ended up losing my job. At this point in March 2020 I was already looking into changing from working full time to coding full time. I was going to start with part time after deciding I wouldn’t be able to give enough effort while working a full time job. When I got let go it made my decision easy to jump in full time. I know this will be difficult, but this isn’t suppose to be easy. It is a career change and life altering decision. I am excited to move forward with this and share my experiences to hopefully help others along the way.
