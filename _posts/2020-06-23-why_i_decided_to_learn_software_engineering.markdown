  When I was looking to make a career change that would better myself going forward in fall of 2019. I was looking into a few things of interest. I love sports, music, and traveling. I wanted to find not only a new career path, but something that would be fun to succeed in. 

I have always had interest in computer programming and technology just in general. When I went through numorous job sites looking at what was available out in the world I was reminded that this was almost what my original career was. When I first started school back in 2003 I was in a Computer Programming degree programming before ultimately switching to Business Administration. I made the switch solely because I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with my life and ended up in the world of Auto Finance because I love working with numbers, problem solving, and loved being around car shows. This wore on me after 14 years. In January 2020 I started looking into coding bootcamps and refreshing my memory on JavaScript.
	
	When Covid hit the world, I like many people ended up losing my job. At this point in March I was already looking into coding bootcamp. I was going to go into it part time, but once I lost my job it helped make the decision to go full time and submerse myself into this journey of not only changing my career, but my life. I am excited for what will come of this and look forward to sharing my experience.
