I started this project earlier in the week and was sort of a deer in the headlights since I have been struggling with the scraping and API lessons. I struggled putting together a project that would work with scraping from the internet. I tried a couple times to and even redid the entire project from square one once to try to fix the errors I was running into. I put together a program that works internally, but has not yet integrated the scraping yet. I know I have to figure that out in the next couple weeks to get this to pass. I feel like I just need to walk through a few good examples of it myself for it to click. I like where the framework of the project is right now and I think this is something I will workon afterwards to eventually use the framework to create an app of my own. 

I am a huge football fan and created a way to look up tiers of positions for fantasy football that could also be used for the NFL Draft. I am excited and disappointed by it since I hit a wall and have run out of time. I have to submit the project half done and get some feed back on what to improve along with adding in the scraping to make it a real program.
