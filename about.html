<p>I worked in the auto finance industry for the last 14 years of my life. I started thinking about a career change late 2019. I decided early 2020 that I wanted to find a bootcamp to completely change my career path into a line of work that fit my interests and skills. I have been dabbling with programming and website building since being a teenager. I am excited to jump in and start this new journey that will kick start the rest of my life.</p>
